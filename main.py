## Answer 
# username = input("what is your username? :")
# print(username)


####Create a variable tha will store the users name.(1 mark)
# name = ("Alessandro")
# print(name)


####Create a print statement that will print the first 4 characters of the person's name.(3 marks)
# name = ("Alessandro")
# print(name[ :4])



####Convert the user's name to all uppercase characters and print the result
# name = input("What's your username?: ")
# name1 = str.upper(name)
# print(name1)




####Find out how many times the letter A occurs in the user's name
# name =("Alessandro")
# str.count(name)






#### Create a conditional statement to ask a user to enter their age. If they are older than 18 they receive a message saying they can enter the competition, if they are under 18, they receive a message saying they cannot enter the competition.
# statement = int(input("enter your age :"))
# if statement > 18:

# elif statement <= 18:
#  print("they cannot enter the competition")


#### Create an empty list called squareNumbers (3 marks)
# squareNumbers = []

#### Square numbers are the solutions to a number being multiplied by itself( example 1 is a square number because 1 X 1 = 1, 4 is a square number because 2 X 2 = 4 ). 
###Calculate the first 20 square numbers and put them in the list called squareNumbers. (With loop and .append 10 marks, without, Max 6 marks).
# count = 1
# while count <21:
#   num = count*count
#   squareNumbers.append(num)
#   count+=1



####Print your list (1 mark)]
# mainthings = ["potateos", "fruit", "orange", "pizza"]
# print(mainthings)

####Create a variable called userSquare that asks the user for their favourite square number
# userSquare = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# username = input("what is your favourite number:")
# if userSquare = (2)
# print("it is my favourite numeber")



#### Add this variable to the end of your list called SquareNumbers

### Create a variable called choice. This variable should choose a random element from your list. Print the variable called choice.(3 marks)
# choice = ["potateos", "fruit", "orange", "pizza"]
# print(choice)


####Create another print statement that prints tha following output: The random square number is: XX, where XX is where the random square number chosen by the computer.(4 marks)
